# ZTC Wallet Dashboard

A simple token balance checker built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This dashboard simulates checking token balances for a given wallet address, perfect for testing Web3 front-end logic without needing blockchain integration.

> 🔁 This project is an upgraded version of my earlier (https://github.com/aikonre/token-balance-dashboard), now enhanced with Tailwind CSS and Vite for better styling and performance.
